      <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Fest. I am an undergrade at Oklahoma State Univeristy where I am studying Computer Science. When I graduate, I hope to take my education into the field of cyber security and networking.<br><br> Additionaly, I delve into graphic and digital design, both in hobby and professional studies. I have been involved in design for over 5 years including one year attending the Graphic Design school at Oklahoma State. I am always experimenting with new techniques, styles, and theories to enrich my overall skill set.<br><br>
      I feel qualified for the position as web designer because of my overarching skills in asthetic and interative design. Though I am not the best web coder, I strive to always learn new techniques, learn from mistakes, and exhibit critical thinking to ensure that I am performing on par to expectations.<br> <br> I do have a good sense of mathematical and computational logic, which I have been able to use to great effect in my studies. I am also a strong advocate for proper and efficiant communication within and outside the work environment, as I feel communication is one of the most important factors to a successful organization.<br><br>  I am excited for this position because I would be able to apply my skills towards an actual, real world project. It would be great experience in developing my career goals and improving my programming abilites.</p>
